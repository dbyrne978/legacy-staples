    <h1>Top 5 Black Legacy Staples</h1>
    <div class="color-overview-text">
        <p>The top black staples don't accurately represent what the color
            black is trying to do in Legacy, as three of the five cards
            listed don't require any black mana to use. Surgical
            Extraction, Leyline of the Void, and Faerie Macabre can all be
            played in the sideboard of any deck as cheap answers to some of
            the more narrow strategies in the format. Thoughtseize provides
            a more general answer to any strategy if you are actually using
            black mana. Lastly, Dark Ritual continues to fuel all-in decks
            that want to cast spells quickly.
