    <h1>Top 5 White Legacy Staples</h1>
    <div class="color-overview-text">
        <p>White gets good removal with cards like Swords to Plowshares and
            Prismatic Ending. Timeless Dragon is a large, evasive finisher
            for control decks that has to be answered twice in most cases
            thanks to Eternalize. Deafening Silence is played in the sideboard
            to help against strategies that want to cast a flurry of spells
            in a single turn to win the game. Stoneforge Mystic is an old
            staple whose tutor ability continues to get more powerful with
            each new equipment that is released.
